    <Textarea class= "Textarea" id="Textarea" rows="25" cols= "75">Welcome to A Song of Ice and Fire: Tyrion's Adventure! (Based on the a series novels written by George R.R Martin).........WINTER IS COMING! 
  
  You will be playing as Tyrion Lannister...the wealthy, witty, and whimsical Imp. You find yourself in quite the predicament...like always.
  
  With an aching head and a dry mouth from what you presume to be from another overdose of Dornish wine from last night, you find yourself slowly lifting up your body off the cold dirty ground. Shortly after pulling yourself up, you slip into a pile of manure. I guess your visit to Ashford didn't go as planned. Time to weasel your way back to your home in King's Landing, again.
  
  Your journey starts in a mild inebriation covered in a mixture of manure and hay. In the middle of the town square involuntarily disguised as a common folk, the first decision awaits. With a fogged mind you recall that King's Landing is somewhat NORTHEAST of here, but first you must gather some of your lost belongings and embark on a dangerous navigation back home.</Textarea>
